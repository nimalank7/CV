#### Teaching

In my role as an IT Trainer at the Cabinet Office I taught and trained Civil Servants in using Google's productivity platform (G Suite). I did this primarily through online webinars as well as face-to-face and group sessions. I also responded to user enquiries regarding particular problems with the G Suite through our shared inbox. Before this I was a secondary school teacher.

- I have led group training sessions as well as 1-1 training sessions for Deputy Directors and Senior Civil Servants (SCS)
- I designed and created an induction session for new starters joining our team which is now still in use.
- I designed course materials to use in giving face-to-face training on the new Gmail UI which I then delivered at our regional offices

#### Line Management

I had been in my role as an IT Trainer in the Cabinet Office for 3 months when my line manager went on extended annual leave and I was required to manage all the training and successfully onboard a new starter by her return.

- I designed and created all the materials needed to successfully onboard our new starter. These materials are now used in my team whenever new starters are onboarded
- I arranged a User Research Lab visit to GDS for my new starter
- I also attended Line Manager Training (LMT) to consolidate my skills and knowledge

#### Deployments

In addition to my daily responsibilities I also voluntarily contributed to a system upgrade project.

- I successfully built laptops for use in the system upgrade project
- I successfully deployed users and ensured they were confident in using their new laptop
- I designed and created a deployment guide and trained other teams to deploy new starters
- I analysed our user records and discovered that the user list was inaccurate by ~80 users. I then identified these users which allowed teams in which these users were from which allowed the team to successfully deploy them.
